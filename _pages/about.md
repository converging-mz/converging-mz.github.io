I am a postdoctoral researcher at Argonne National Laboratory, working with Dr. [Nicholas Chia](https://www.anl.gov/profile/nicholas-leeping-chia) on AI for Science. I received my Ph.D. in Physics from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, where I was advised by Prof. [Nigel Goldenfeld](https://guava.physics.ucsd.edu/~nigel/).
